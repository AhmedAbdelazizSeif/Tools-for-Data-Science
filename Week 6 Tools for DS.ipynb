    "Welcome to this Jupyter Notebook, designed for the peer graded assignment of the Data Science and its Tools course. In this assignment, we will explore the exciting field of Data Science and the tools commonly used by data scientists to extract valuable insights from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that combines various techniques, algorithms, and tools to uncover patterns, make predictions, and gain meaningful insights from complex datasets. It involves the process of collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting data to make informed decisions and solve real-world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, we will be utilizing Jupyter, an interactive computing environment, to perform data analysis, visualization, and coding tasks. Jupyter notebooks provide a flexible and collaborative platform for writing and executing code, displaying visualizations, and documenting our analysis in a single environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we will also explore other essential tools commonly used in Data Science, such as Python, a versatile programming language known for its rich libraries and frameworks for data manipulation and analysis. Additionally, we may leverage libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, which are widely used for data processing, numerical computations, and visualization tasks.\n",
